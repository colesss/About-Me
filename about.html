        <h3>Where I am from</h3>
          <p>I was born in California and moved up the coast when I was 5. My parents intended to move to Canada but on the way they visited a tiny tourist town called Leavenworth. Leavenworth is a tiny bavarian village located 2-3 hours east of Seattle, nestled in the mountains. I grew up there for most of my formative years before I moved to Seattle after graduation school.</p>
        <h3>My family</h3>
          <p>My family consists of my parents and three siblings. My father is deceased but my mother still lives in Leavenworth as well as my brother. My sister lives in Germany. For your information, we don't have a drop fo german in any of us, this is all a coincidence.</p>
        <h3>What I drink</h3>
          <p>I enjoy beer and spirits. Beer of choice will always be something hoppy. Typcially I like to drink IPAs but I will occasionally drink ambers and pale ales if they are a bit hoppy. I also enjoy drinking liquor, unmixed. I am not a fan of sweet drinks. My current favorite is gin on the rocks. Hey! No judgement! It's a fast no fuss martini.</p>
        <h3>What I eat</h3>
          <p>Favorite foods consists of mexican foods and italian foods. I like noodles a lot! I also enjoy cheese, the creamier the better.</p>
