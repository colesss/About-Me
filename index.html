    <h1>Welcome to Cole's About Me Page</h1>
    <p class="page-content">I was born in California. Grew up in Leavenworth. No!!! Not the prison town! Yes, the bavarian village in Washington State. Yes, people do live there. No, I do not go back. Ok, think that answered all the anticipated questions regarding.</p>
    <p class="page-content">I moved to Seattle in 2005. I learned to dance. Lindy, Blues, Tango, etc. I traveled the world a bit, dancing in different corners of the globe. I went to school for accounting. Loved the numbers and mental work. It didn't quite suit me a hundred percent though. So here I am again, starting another direction.</p>
    <p class="page-content"id="unique-p-tag">Little details about me. I love tattoos and piercings. I love art, particularly the darker sides of it. I love tea and coffee. I love a great IPA, the hoppier the better. I also enjoy alcohol, but not generally not mixed. On the rocks usually or served in a way that I can slowly enjoy it. I enjoy a great imaginative book while curled up on the couch with a dog cuddled next to me or in my lap.</p>
